Traditional means it includes redundant dashes
[Tri]decadashes (Simplified) would include only the newly added dash, along with the anchoring dash.
Also, if not using N0, that gives you (13+8)= 21 possible bases, though I'd suggest using Simplified for that.
_If attempting to draw simplified, I'd suggest giving the numbers a bit of character, while preserving the pattern, since it's basically the arabic numerals, but with a regular (ish) pattern._

(But it wouldn't be as charming, would it?)

Anyways, everything else is the same, no new symbols or operations or anything.

This is best used for alternative civilizations, not really even just alien, it truly could've been developed by a human civilization, past or future, and could be used for anything.
