# Tridecidashes
### _A numeral system for Tridecimal (base-13) and below_

Traditional means it includes redundant dashes
[Tri]decadashes (Simplified) would include only the newly added dash, along with the anchoring dash
(But it wouldn't be as charming, would it?)

Anyways, everything else is the same, no new symbols or operations or anything.

This is best used for alternative civilizations, not really even just alien, it truly could've been developed by a human civilization, past or future, and could be used for anything.

I'll probably make some art for what Simplified could be, since it's basically the arabic numerals, but they actually follow rules
